        <p>I have a compelling drive to understand the way things work. I am action-oriented and like to be up and about doing things. I am loyal to my causes and beliefs and believe programming to be a canvas to express rational, logical and artistic problem solving. </p>

        </p>Working in a trading desk for many years, I learned to work under stress and vast amounts of responsibility. Market fluctuations and intense atmosphere elevated my sense of expediency and grasp of the details which enables quick, effective decisions.</p>
